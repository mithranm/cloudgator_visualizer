## Introduction

This report provides an analysis of cloud instance prices based on CPU and GPU compute units. The data covers various cloud instance details from multiple providers, allowing for a robust comparison of cost-efficiency.

## Methodology

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
The analysis begins by reading a merged CSV file (`pl_output/merged_data.csv`) and converting the `timestamp` column to a standard date-time format. Numerical columns (such as `vcpus` and `memory_gib`) are explicitly cast to numeric types to ensure correct computations.

### CPU Compute Unit Analysis
For CPU analysis, a compute score is defined as:

\[
\text{cpu\_compute\_score} = \text{vcpus} + \frac{\text{memory\_gib}}{4}
\]

The hourly price is then normalized by dividing by this compute score:

\[
\text{cpu\_norm\_price} = \frac{\text{price\_per\_hour}}{\text{cpu\_compute\_score}}
\]

Median values for the normalized CPU price are computed for each provider to allow a robust comparison across different offerings.

### GPU Compute Unit Analysis
For GPU analysis, instances with an unknown GPU model are filtered out. A lookup table assigns a score to each GPU model based on experimental benchmarks. The total GPU compute score is calculated as:

\[
\text{total\_gpu\_compute} = \text{gpu\_score} \times \text{gpu\_count}
\]

The normalized GPU price is obtained by:

\[
\text{gpu\_norm\_price} = \frac{\text{price\_per\_hour}}{\text{total\_gpu\_compute}}
\]

Median values are then computed per provider to mitigate the impact of outliers.

## Results
